## Template starter for basic web development

This is a lightweight and simple template for basic web development, includes [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) management for easier workflow.

### The template has three folders.

* __static__ folder for assets like libraries, images and fonts that don't require intervention.
* __src__ folder for workspace, here is **where the work gets done!**.
* __build__ folder where the progress is saved.

To use this template you must install and use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).
